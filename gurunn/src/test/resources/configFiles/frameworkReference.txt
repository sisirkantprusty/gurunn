How to read the project and test cases 

- Automation framework follows the Page object model design pattern and uses TestNG to create test cases.
- Chromedriver is in src/test/resources
- config.properties file stores the url  



##Incase test groups are used for test methods
example groups is used for test method then to make sure beforeMethod and afterMethod to run use alwaysRun=true
@Test(description = "Test case to verify that user can not add more than Product available in the store", groups = {"shoppingcart"}), then have this @BeforeMethod(alwaysRun=true)
